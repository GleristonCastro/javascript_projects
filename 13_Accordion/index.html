          JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language widely used in web development to create interactivity on web pages.

      <div class="accordion-header">What is the difference between let and var?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          The main difference between let and var is scope. 'let' has block scope, which means the variable can only be accessed within the block where it's defined, whereas 'var' has function scope, allowing the variable to be accessed throughout the function where it's defined.

      <div class="accordion-header">What is a callback function?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function. The callback function is then invoked inside the receiving function, allowing it to be executed at some later time or in response to some event.
